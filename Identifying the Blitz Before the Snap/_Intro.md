This project examines gameplay characteristics of NFL football to best identify a quarterback blitz. 
Data is sourced from the 2022 NFL Big Data Bowl, but is not an entrant nor does it follow the theme of the 2022 contest. 
For examination of current research and detailed analysis, please see `BlitzBeforeSnap_Whitepages`. 

**AUTHOR'S NOTE** In its current state, this project is a good example of supervised learning, more specifically, 
an examination of classification methods such as random forest and logistic regression. However, it does not currently 
provide novel insight - citing Cover-0 and a large number of defensive players near the line of scrimmage as key 
factor of identifying a blitz - obvious factors to any armchair quarterback. 

Ongoing refinement of this project hopes to suggest detailed, individualized mannerism that may suggest a blitz.
