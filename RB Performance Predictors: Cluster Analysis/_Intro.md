This project utilized key performance indicators (KPI) observed during the NFL Combine to 
cluster running backs. A variety of studies suggested that for running backs, weight, 
40-yard dash time, and cone drill time were the most significant indicators of 
future performance in the NFL (Please see `RBEval_Whitepages.pdf` for futher discussion
and citation of these studies). 

Creation of groups using K-Means clustering resulted in four running back classifications:
|Cluster Number|Cluster Name|Forty-Yard Dash Time [s]|Weight [lbs]|Cone Drill Time [s]|
|:--------:|-----------|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|0|Dual Threat|4.52|202.4|6.90|
|1|Rugged RBs|4.52|216.5|7.01|
|2|Power Players|4.60|251.7|7.19|
|3|Mid-Range RBs|4.57|228.4|7.12|

**PLEASE NOTE**
This project was completed for a course titled, *Fundamentals of Coaching*. As such, 
athletes from the 2021 draft class were assigned to each cluster and prescribed
a sample strength and conditioning workout that best emphasized the traits of
each cluster. These sessions can be found in `RBEval_Whitepages.pdf`.
