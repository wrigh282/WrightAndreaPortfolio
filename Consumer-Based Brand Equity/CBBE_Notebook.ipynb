It gives us insight into things such as consumer preferences and consumer's thoughts on a specific item. Throughout this project, Consumer-Based Brand Equity (CBBE) will be evaluated. This metric refers to the consumer attitude towards a brand and is rated on a 1 (unfavorable)  to 5 (favorable) scale. More specifically, we will be looking at the Customer Loyalty factor of CBBE. CBBE is evaluated using a series of statements relating to brand-event personality fit (BEPF) which was administered via the survey. \n","\n","Consumers were evaluated via a quesionnaire that employed the Likert scale. The Likert scale is from 1 (bad, dislike) to 7  (good, like) for this survey. \n","\n","This project intends to help marketing companies further understand the consumer and the specific attributes that are most related to customer loyalty. With this information, partnerships and sponsorships between company and sport/team can further be leveraged in an attempt to help maximize the marketing techniques and maintain loyal customers. \n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ypC4oxwO_JHm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.2 Research Goals <font color='red'> \n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"pW8YbphY_J4r"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The goal of this project is to further understand the consumer loyalty. More specifically, we seek to understand what makes our youngest consumers, 18-21 year-olds loyal to a brand. This is an ideal age range to build loyalty with the hopes that they will continue to remain loyal and not switch to a rival company throughout their lifetime. \n","\n","This analysis will allow the brand to further understand how to target this specific demographic. Then, marketing companies can implement strategies to keep these individuals and further build the relationship between consumer and brand. \n","\n","***Our ultimate goal is to better understand the factors contributing to customer loyalty, and find ways to implement this to the specified demographic range.***"],"metadata":{"id":"Gd-gsdQGI9r5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.3 Key Assumptions\n","\n","We assume the following about the data before completing any analysis:\n","\n","\n","*   Simple random sampling was employed when distributing the questionnaire so as not to pull from a specific group (i.e. questionnaire was not distributed to a single Greek organization attending the game).\n","*   Consumers completed the questionnaire with honesty, to the best of their ability, and, if questionnaires were distributed at or around the time of a game, they were sufficiently non-inebriated. \n","*   All observations provided are associated to a single company, the identity of which is unknown to data anlysts but was provided to questionnaire-takers. (I.e. All observations provided are about customer's opinion of Coca-Cola, not a mix of Coca-Cola and Delta Airlines).\n","*   Indicators of Brand Awareness, Quality, and Loyalty were composed of 3 components each. We assume that, as the questionnarie is written, each component holds equal weight for their respective indicators. (Ex. The first question regarding Brand Awareness does not hold higher importance or indicate greater awareness than the remaining two questions when the questionnaire is delivered to the consumer). \n"," \n"],"metadata":{"id":"bEmCmNkN7ef1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 2.

There is room for research with regards to the association between these two groups alone, from which we may see a more complex relationship. \n","\n","3. One weakness that is quite obvious is the fact it is a survey. When giving out a questionaire like this you never know how serious someone takes this as they may be rushing or not filling it out to how they truly feel. This could be more true as it varies across an age group. For example, people aged 18-21 might not care as much about answering truthfully versus someone who is aged 27+. This could be for any reason but we truthfully don't know. \n","\n","4. The scope of this project is limited. We evaluate loyalty for a single age range (18-21 years) in an attempt to maintain them as customers. However, these opinions may change with age. For example, the quality of a company being \"down-to-earth\" was negatively associated for this age group. As this group grows older, it is likely this could change and as such, marketing strategies implemented for them may no longer work. Additionally, there are generational differences that exist. In other words, the qualities that indicate loyalty for this particular set of 18-21 year-olds may be different than the next round of 18-21 year-olds. A longitudinal study may be required to evaluate whether the same BEPF factors are applicable across generations. Additional studies should be conducted to determine the most significant BEPF factors across different age groups. "],"metadata":{"id":"uKG91idXUeZb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 8.
