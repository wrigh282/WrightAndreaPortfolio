As a crucial marketing asset, consumer-based brand equity (CBBE) has been studied in a broad
array of professional fields, with consistent findings of its positive influence on promoting
consumer preferences and purchase intentions (Cobb-Walgren, Ruble, & Donthu, 1995),
elevating consumer-perceived quality toward products (Dodds, Monroe, & Grewal, 1991),
improving consumer evaluation of brand extensions (D.A. Aaker & Keller, 1990), and enhancing
resilience in product-harm crises (Dawar & Pillutla, 2000). Understandably, corporations are
always seeking efficient ways to build strong CBBE.

This project examines questionnaire responses relating to CBBE of a brand. Questionnaires were distributed 
at a large NCAA football game. For more information regarding the population, please see
